Pearson Education is a leading provider of textbooks and eTextbooks for higher education students and instructors.

Educators can add their own notes directly in the eTextbook, right at the teachable moment â motivating students to keep reading, and keep learning[^2^].
 
If you want to get access to Pearson Education eBooks, you will need an access code. An access code is a 12- or 15-digit alphanumeric code that is printed on a card or included in an email that you receive when you purchase or rent a Pearson eTextbook. You can also buy an access code online from Pearson or from a third-party retailer. An access code can only be redeemed by one user, for one use[^1^].
